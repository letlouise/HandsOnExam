              This project was my first responsive portfolio website. I learned a
              lot about html using div, nav, image and link tags. I also created
              a css file and picked out tags using classes and direct names and
              stylished my html to make it look clean and accessible to all. I then 
              learn how to use the terminal and then how to use git, so I could 
              backup files to github and keep track of changes, etc.

            <h1>Making a design system from scratch</h1>
            <p>12 Sep 2024 Design | Code Pattern</p>
            <p class="post-article">
                A design system is a comprehensive set of guidelines, components,
                and tools that enable teams to create consistent and scalable user
                interfaces. It ensures alignment between design and development,
                streamlines workflows, and enhances user experience. Building a
                design system from scratch can be a complex process, but with a
                systematic approach, it becomes manageable and rewarding.

            <p class="post-article">
                I have learned Flexbox, a powerful CSS layout tool. It helps create
                flexible, responsive designs with ease. Using Flexbox, I can align
                and distribute elements efficiently. This skill improves my ability
                to build modern, user-friendly web pages.

                In the future, I want to be a computer programmer who creates solutions to
                make life easier and better. Programming is not just about writing code; it’s
                about solving problems, building new things, and shaping the future with technology.
                I hope to work on projects like developing apps, creating websites, or exploring
                artificial intelligence. These tools can help businesses grow, make daily tasks simpler,
                and improve healthcare and education. To reach my goal, I will learn programming
                languages like Python, JavaScript, and C++. I also want to improve my problem-solving
                skills, work well in teams, and stay updated with new technology. I know it won’t always
                be easy, but I’m ready to learn and grow. Most importantly, I want my work to make a
                difference. Whether it’s creating tools for people with disabilities or contributing to
                open-source projects, I want to help others. My dream is to build great programs and use
                technology to make the world a better place.

                In the future, I want to become an app engineer, building applications that
                help people in their daily lives. Apps are everywhere helping us communicate,
                learn, work, and have fun. I want to create apps that are useful, easy to use,
                and enjoyable. To achieve this, I will learn important skills like coding in
                languages such as Java, Swift, and Python, and understanding how apps work on
                different platforms like Android and iOS. I also want to improve my problem-solving
